<h1><a name="display" />Displaying schedules</h1>
Calendar can display events in a few different ways. These are: <a href="#display_agenda">Agenda</a>, <a href="#display_gridviews_dayview">Day View</a>, <a href="#display_gridviews_weekview">Week View</a>, <a href="#display_gridviews_monthview">Month View</a> and <a href="#display_yearview">Year View</a>. You can switch between them by clicking on the respective tabs while in Calendar module.
<br /><img src="calendar_views.png" />
<h2><a name="display_agenda" />Agenda</h2>
<br />Agenda puts events in a list, one under another. It gives you posibillity to view events in a few useful orders, for example chronologically.
<br /><img src="calendar_agenda.png" />
<ol>
 <li>
  This panel determines time range for which events are displayed. You can set this range by determinig From and To dates. To do this write the proper dates in fields "From" and "To" or choose them using <a href="#details_smallcalendar">"Select date"</a> buttons. After that click "Show" button and the right events will be displayed.
 </li>
 <li>
  This bar, apart from obvious informational usage, serves as the sorting tool. All fields here, except "Actions", work as sorting buttons. When you click them, you choose the value by which the events are sorted and also toggle ascending/descending order.
 </li>
 <li>
  This icon idicates, that the event is repeatable. Such an event can occur with one of the few different frequencies, for instance once a week on Monday.
 </li>
 <li>
  These buttons serve as shortcuts to the common <a href="#details_actions">actions</a> you might want to perform on the events.
 </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="display_gridviews">Grid views</h2>
<a href="#display_gridviews_dayview">Day View</a>, <a href="#display_gridviews_weekview">Week View</a> and <a href="#display_gridviews_monthview">Month View</a> display events by showing them on time grids. <a href="#display_gridviews_dayview">Day View</a> and <a href="#display_gridviews_weekview">Week View</a> focus on showing the starting dates, duration and overlaping of events. <a href="#display_gridviews_monthview">Month View</a> is more general and display events on the right days, without further details, but in a larger scope.

 <tr style="vertical-align:top;">

In the <a href="#display_gridviews_monthview">Month View</a> the size is fixed. You can see here some basic information, like the starting time of the event and usually shortened version of event's title. There is a small icon <img src="calendar_i.png" /> in the top left corner of the frame. When you hover mouse over it, <a href="#view_eventtooltip">details of the event</a> will be displayed. When you click on this icon, then menu with <a href="#details_actions">actions</a> will be displayed.
