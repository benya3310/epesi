1.	REQUIREMENTS

•	HTTP web server (apache, IIS) with PHP 5.0 support. If possible install the latest PHP version due to several bugs in older version.
•	HTTP server should be configured with index.php as one of default documents.
•	MySQL or PostgreSQL database server.
•	FTP or local/shell access to the server.
•	Firefox browser.

2.	CHOOSE INSTALLATION METHOD

	New installation or upgrade. For upgrade see Upgrade section.
•	Installation from compressed file via FTP or local access (shell etc.)
•	Easy installation using easyinstall script (preferred method).

3.	NEW INSTALLATION USING COMPRESSED FILE

•	Download the latest version of epesiBIM from http://sourceforge.net/projects/epesi/
•	If downloaded to a server directly then decompress all files and place them in the directory from which epesi will be run. You will need to setup directory data with read/write access.
•	Create a database, note the username, password and database name. Make sure that the user has full rights to the database (read, write, create tables etc.)
•	Point your browser to the location from which epesi will be run, for example: http://www.yourcompany.com/epesi
•	Epesi setup should start automatically. Accept license agreement and the setup wizard will guide you through all steps which includes creation of the configuration file config.php, necessary directories within data directory, tables, superadmin user account and password and default data etc.
•	When asked which version you would like to install choose CRM or CRM with Bugtracker. Base and Full is for advanced users willing to play with epesi framework.
•	When installing CRM or CRM with Bugtracker version you will be prompted for Main Company information including the address etc.
•	Finally the setup scans all available modules and you will be greeted with the default dashboard. The installation is complete.
•	Create new users as new contacts and explore the application.
 
4.	NEW INSTALLATION USING EASYINSTALL.PHP SCRIPT

•	Create a database, note the username, password and database name. Make sure that the user has full rights to the database (read, write, create tables etc.)
•	Download the latest version of easyinstall script from http://sourceforge.net/projects/epesi/
•	Place the file in the directory from which epesi will be run. There is no need to download the entire epesiBIM application as a compressed file. This easy install script automatically connects to SourceForge server, downloads the latest version, verifies it, decompresses files on the server, sets proper directory permissions and starts epesi setup.
•	Accept license agreement and the setup wizard will guide you through all steps which includes creation of the configuration file config.php, necessary directories within data directory, tables, superadmin user account and password and default data etc.
•	When asked which version you would like to install choose CRM or CRM with Bugtracker. Base and Full is for advanced users willing to play with epesi framework.
•	When installing CRM or CRM with Bugtracker version you will be prompted for Main Company information including the address etc.
•	Finally the setup scans all available modules and you will be greeted with the default dashboard. The installation is complete.
•	Create new users as new contacts and explore the application.

5.	REINSTALLATION

•	By reinstallation we mean complete, new installation of the application without preserving any of the old data. 
•	Open config.php located in data directory and note the database name, user and the password. You will need to enter the same data during the setup.
•	Delete the entire content of data directory with the exception of index.html file (which is needed for security reason).
•	Point your browser to the location from which epesi was running, for example: http://www.yourcompany.com/epesi
•	Follow instruction above as if it was new installation.

6.	UPGRADE

•	Before upgrading the application backup the entire application directory and especially data directory.
•	Backup also the database.
•	Download the new version of epesi and overwrite all files.
•	Point your browser to the location from which epesi was running, for example: http://www.yourcompany.com/epesi
•	If the database schema did not change you will be already running new version.
•	If the database schema did change the upgrade process will start automatically during which tables will be altered to this new database schema.
•	Once upgrade process is complete you will be redirected automatically to the new version of epesi application.

7.	SVN USERS

•	If you are a developer or simply frequently updating epesiBIM to get the latest version and latest bugs fixes we recommend downloading the application from our SourceForge SVN repository. You will need SVN client which can be downloaded from http://subversion.tigris.org/
•	Our repository address is: https://epesi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epesi/trunk

•	If you are new to using SVN this link will help you:
•	http://haacked.com/archive/2006/02/22/QuickstartGuidetoSubversiononSourceForge.aspx

•	When using SVN you can get more frequent updates and bug fixes. The procedure to upgrade epesiBIM using SVN is the same as described in Upgrade section. The only difference is that instead of downloading the entire application and overwriting all application files SVN client will automatically detect only those files that changed since the last synchronization, therefore the process is more efficient.
